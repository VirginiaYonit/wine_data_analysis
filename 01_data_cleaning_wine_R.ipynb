    "# 1 Project Idea: \n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparative Analysis of Data Cleaning in Python and R\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the red and white wine datasets from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality), with a focus on comparative data cleaning and preparation. 1.2.1 Data Sources¶\n",
    "The original datasets used in this project come from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "They were contributed by Paulo Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos, and J. Reis, and are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach integrates real-world winemaking standards, including EU regulations and OIV guidelines, to ensure chemical plausibility, legal consistency, and contextual insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to identify and preserve meaningful variability while removing noise, ultimately producing clean, structured datasets for future modeling or reporting tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Emphasizing methodical thinking, attention to detail, and reproducibility, the analysis goes beyond standard statistical thresholds by incorporating chemical plausibility and relevant international benchmarks. Where applicable—particularly for sulfur dioxide, alcohol, and other regulated compounds—thresholds from the International Code of Oenological Practices (OIV) are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific insights into the nature of each variable support the cleaning process, without diverting from the main objective: to produce clean, interpretable data suitable for modeling and further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red and white wine datasets are treated separately to ensure clarity and consistency throughout the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonstrate a domain-aware data cleaning process focused on outlier detection and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore the distribution of physicochemical variables across both red and white wines\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify and visualize potential outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decide whether to remove, retain, or flag each outlier based on context and plausibility\n",
    "\n",
    "* Produce a reproducible, interpretable dataset for downstream analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure clarity through structured documentation, visualizations, and transparent code\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Data Sources\n",
    "The original datasets used in this project were obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data was contributed by Paulo Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos, and J. Reis, and is distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution license.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two datasets are included, corresponding to red and white Vinho Verde wine samples from northern Portugal. Each entry represents a wine sample with 11 physicochemical variables and one quality score based on sensory evaluation. The objective of the original dataset is to model wine quality based on measurable chemical properties.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Tools and Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was developed in R (v4.4.2) using a Jupyter Notebook environment. \n",
    "Initial drafts were occasionally reviewed in Posit Cloud and RStudio Desktop.\n",
    "Key libraries include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tidyverse** – data manipulation and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **readxl** – Excel file import\n",
    "\n",
    "- **skimr** – compact data summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "- **here** – reproducible file paths\n",
    "\n",
    "- **janitor** – data cleaning utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **conflicted** – function name conflict management\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All code is designed to be fully reproducible. The data is stored locally with backups maintained on Posit Cloud for accessibility and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.3 Reproducibility & Version Control\n",
    "Code and data are versioned and stored securely. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.4 Comparative Framing: Python vs R for Data Cleaning\n",
    "This analysis is part of a broader project aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of R and Python for real-world data cleaning workflows. The two environments are tested side by side on the same datasets, using consistent logic, criteria, and decision points.\n",
    "\n",
    "By developing a parallel workflow across both languages, this project aims to assess:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the clarity and expressiveness of syntax in each language;\n",
    "\n",
    "- the efficiency and flexibility of standard packages for data manipulation and visualization;\n",
    "\n",
    "- the ability to document, automate, and scale the cleaning process in a reproducible and structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although both languages are highly capable, each has particular strengths depending on the task. This project explores not just which tool is \"better,\" but how each supports strategic thinking and technical transparency in data preparation — a critical phase in any data science or machine learning pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**These definitions apply to both red and white wine datasets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **fixed_acidity**: Concentration of tartaric acid (primary acid in grapes), impacts freshness and structure.\n",
    "- **volatile_acidity**: Mainly acetic acid, contributes to aroma but excessive levels lead to vinegary notes.\n",
    "- **citric_acid**: Adds freshness and complexity; can contribute to balance.\n",
    "- **residual_sugar**: Sugar left after fermentation; affects sweetness and body.\n",
    "- **chlorides**: Indicates saltiness, influenced by soil and water; high levels may affect flavor.\n",
    "- **free_sulfur_dioxide**: Active SO₂ available to protect wine from oxidation/microbes.\n",
    "- **total_sulfur_dioxide**: Sum of free and bound SO₂; high levels may affect aroma and require labeling.\n",
    "- **density**: Indicates dissolved substances (sugar, alcohol); helps infer sweetness.\n",
    "- **pH**: Measures acidity/basicity; affects microbial stability and sensory freshness.\n",
    "- **sulphates**: Help prevent microbial spoilage and contribute to mouthfeel.Too much can cause headaches or affect taste.\n",
    "- **alcohol**: Final ethanol concentration (% vol); reflects sugar conversion during fermentation.\n",
    "- **quality**: Sensory evaluation score (integer); subjectively assigned by experts.\n"

    "## 3.1 Fixed Acidity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**  \n",
    "Fixed acidity refers to the concentration of non-volatile acids—mainly tartaric and malic acid—that remain in the wine after fermentation. These acids are essential for freshness, microbial stability, and aging potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary Statistics**  \n",
    "Values range from 4.50 to 14.20 g/L, with a median of 6.80 and a mean of 6.84. Most observations fall within the expected range for white wines, although a few outliers reach significantly higher values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Interpretation**  \n",
    "The Vinho Verde region encompasses a wide variety of microclimates and grape types—over 45 authorized varieties—offering a rich palette of winemaking expressions. Since the Portuguese wine industry’s technological transformation in the 1970s and ’80s, it continues to evolve, led by grower-vignerons and innovative, winemaker-driven projects focused on varietal and sub-regional styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This confluence of maritime and continental influences—with increasingly hotter, drier summers—produces grapes that ripen fully while preserving the region’s hallmark acidity and aromatic freshness. Thanks to its network of rivers and higher elevation zones to the east, cool nighttime temperatures help preserve acidity, even in warmer vintages.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Miguel Queimado (Vale das Ares) notes, “I have one grape. If I want different styles, I need to individuate,” which he achieves through vineyard orientation. His freshest, most structured Alvarinho comes from a north-facing slope, while his entry-level wine—fruitier and higher in alcohol—is sourced from lower, west-facing plots. Even stylistic shifts are underway: malolactic fermentation, once rare, is being explored in earlier-picked wines to soften mouthfeel and balance acidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision**  \n",
    "Such diversity in climate, technique, and style justifies the presence of high fixed acidity values in our dataset. These outliers likely represent legitimate stylistic choices rather than errors or anomalies.  \n",

    "# 4 Final Remarks – Data Cleaning Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "This cleaning process was built step by step, with a close look at each variable—across both red and white wines.  \n",
    "Legal thresholds were applied upfront, but what followed was an individual review of every outlier, not just by the numbers but with a chemical and contextual lens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where needed, values were removed—especially when clearly outside plausible physical or enological ranges. But many other cases, initially flagged, turned out to reflect stylistic choices, fermentation practices, or just natural diversity. Those were kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was never to force a tidy dataset, but to preserve what made sense and let go of what didn’t. What’s left are two datasets that are coherent, chemically sound, and closer to what real-world wine data often looks like: not perfect, but meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "They’re now ready for the next phase—be it modeling, exploratory visuals, or comparing how R and Python handle the same cleaning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because cleaning isn’t just technical—it’s about reading the data for what it really is, and making informed decisions along the way.\n"
