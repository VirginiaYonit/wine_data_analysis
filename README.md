# Comparative Data Cleaning â€“ Wine Quality Dataset

This repository showcases a two-part project focused on data cleaning and outlier analysis using both **R** and **Python**.  
The dataset contains physicochemical and sensory data for red and white wines from Portugalâ€™s **Vinho Verde** region.

## How to Use This Dataset

Download the dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)
and place the two `.csv` files in your project directory (`winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv`).

Alternatively, you can use the **Kaggle API** for automated downloading, as shown in the Python notebook.

## Project Structure

- `01_data_cleaning_wine_R.ipynb`  
  Comprehensive data cleaning workflow in **R**, integrating references to EU regulatory limits, winemaking styles, and a detailed variable-by-variable review.

- `02_data_cleaning_wine_Python.ipynb`  
  Follow-up analysis in **Python**, focusing on cross-validation, visualization, and enforcing legal/chemical constraints across both datasets.

---

## Objectives

- Explore the distribution of physicochemical variables  
- Identify and visualize potential outliers  
- Clean data based on legal thresholds and scientific plausibility  
- Preserve stylistic variation when justified  
- Build ready-to-use datasets for future modeling or BI use

---

## Topics Covered

- Outlier detection: IQR, standard deviation  
- Validation against EU & OIV standards  
- Contextual variable analysis (e.g., density, alcohol, SOâ‚‚)  
- Visual tools: boxplots, scatterplots, histograms  
- Environment cross-check: R vs Python

## About the Author

Iâ€™m a 53-year-old career-changer with 25 years of experience in air transportation â€” a field that taught me precision, responsibility, and how to operate in complex, regulated environments.  

Today I work with Python and R, combining data analysis with domain awareness and legal context.  
I hold a diploma in Interior Design and bring with me a strong sense of structure, systems, and clarity.

Iâ€™m currently exploring business intelligence to better understand how data supports decision-making, but my goal remains the same: to deliver meaningful results with insight, clarity, and integrity.

## Data Consistency Note

The original datasets used in this project were sourced directly from the  
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality),  
which provides clean, complete data with no missing values.

Note: This project resolves a known decimal locale issue affecting the `pH` variable. See notebook comments for full trace.
